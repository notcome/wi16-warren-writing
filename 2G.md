There are some skills I should have developed with my last paper. However, since I chose to criticize the article by Singer in my first essay, I failed to practice them.

First and foremost, I did not need to actively find a level three question. All I needed to do was to stick with Singer’s arguments. This time I was not so fortunate—though I could have done the same thing, by criticizing Tomar; I chose a harder prompt on purpose—so I made a poor introduction with my discovery draft. At that time, what I was *writing* was that we should analyze the issue of  plagiarism from three different aspects. There is nothing arguable here. Luckily, by putting my proposed principle in the big context, I figured out that I could simply go against copyleft, which is a level three question.

Second, contextualization. As I described in the last paragraph, I found my main claim by looking at my idea in context. This is something missed from my first paper. I have to admit that I didn’t use sources other than the Singer’s article in a meaningful way. Except for the nature of an article review, I didn’t *engage* into the conversation. My interaction with those writers is most clearly reflected by the fact that I picked my content based on points made in these sources. For example, Gladwell expressed his concern on harms done to authors (Gladwell 127), and that’s the theme of my third sub-claim.

I believe the finding the motivating question is the hardest aspect. After I have found the question and evaluated it in the context, the article came naturally. There was no other way to organize the whole article. However, a significant amount of work was required to make my article readable. I developed two strategies to solve this issue. The first is to let my peers read my paper. They pointed out places where my analysis is not clear enough as well as places where I put something implicit. It is difficult for me to keep track of every single step  of reasoning in my mind. Moreover, some ideas are so familiar to me that I take them for granted. Therefore, I believe small conferences are crucial and this course should enforce it after every nontrivial project.

The second strategy is to let myself re-read my own paper a few hours/days after I finished my draft. As the instructor pointed out, I needed to “anticipate what a common reader” would think. Re-reading after some time can make my mind fresh so I can notice things like strange order of sentences. An observation is that my first draft shares little paragraph-level structural similarities with my latest version. I would ask myself to explicitly rewrite the paper as a way to improve readability.
