I have learned a lot of useful stuffs in Warren Writing.

First of all, I realized how to start an essay properly. I should find a level three question. In the past, I often asked a level two question and find my whole essay too trivial, or I would write with a level four question and yield an unconvincing passage. In fact, during the course I actually had some difficulties in finding the correct questions to ask, especially in my second and third paper (cf. 2G). I believe I need to practice more with this, but I am on the right track.

Another very important skill I learned in this course is how to revise my essay. Thanks to the extensive use of peer reviews, I realized lots of issues in my essay. Among them the most prominent is readability—I often think that I have explained something thoroughly, but in fact it is unintelligible to other people. My peers—and the instructor Ms. Perino of course—pointed this out for me for several times. Without them, my final paper cannot be of that quality.

I am confident with my logical skills, but writing an essay is more than proving a proposition. It is about how to spend limited mental resources of readers rationally to convince them in a most efficient way. Ms. Perino has pointed out that while I spent too many words on trivial parts, I often wrote too little on important facts. During my revision, I kept reorganizing my essay so that it was more reader friendly, but this is a skill that I just started to practice. I will continue work on this.
