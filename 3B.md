**Challenge one.** By increasingly relying on big data and focusing on correlation, researchers may be discouraged from finding scientific explanations and become descriptivists of facts. Would not this pose a threat to human intellectuality?

First, there are fields in which we only have “small data”. For example, in field linguistics, language data are sometimes scarce, especially for languages that have few speakers. Linguists have to rely on the traditional analysis approach to describe grammars of these languages. Second, in many fields only research on causes will be accepted. A mathematician cannot, for instance, verify a theorem for all numbers smaller than one million and declares that he or she *proves* the theorem. Therefore, one does not need to worry that big data might pollute the research environment. Third, there are hypotheses so complicated that we have no ways to find rigor and conclusive evidence, like those in comparative politics and cognitive science. In such situations, checking against big data can make these hypotheses more reliable. After all, as said in both the book and the article by Hidalgo, it is better to make some progress than nothing (Mayer-Scheönberger and Cukier 195, Hidalgo 150).

In contrast, it is not unconceivable that using big data can actually make research faster. A political scientist could use big data to discover interesting patterns first before doing in-depth case study. Cognitive scientists can do similar things, saving grants from experiments that do not show much statistical differences.

**Challenge two.** If big data can predict our future actions, what is the meaning of life?

There are two perspectives to this question. First, are long-term predictions possible? No, because we can never gather enough information or have enough computational resource to process them. What we are making are approximations. For a system as complex as those using big data, every small change in input will result in drastic difference in output. Long-term predictions rely on so many variables, so people will hardly be able to make progress in this field. The second aspect is about short-term predictions. For example, if Alice knows that she will have a bad result for tomorrow’s ACT test, she would be extremely upset. Notice that for most people this would not be an issue if the prediction result is on the positive side. Nevertheless, with big data, Alice could understand her issue much earlier so that the chance that she move toward a positive future actually increases.

**Other materials.**

Why big data suddenly matters? In the past, people can only observe a small amount of data. One can imagine a case where people need to discover more about the world. To understand what will happen in some place far far away, people need to ensure their conclusions—based on their observations about the surrounding world—hold universally. This is the beginning of causality and science. However, with the advent of information era, people can now observe anywhere. People no longer need to ensure their conclusions hold in a certain area, since they can observe that area directly.
