Has intellectual property become a concept of the past? Indeed, in the age of Internet, sharing without permission has become a *de facto* standard, as described by Tomar in his book *Use Me* (85). Moreover, other people are arguing that the idea of copyright is wrong in the first place because a new piece of knowledge is always created from old ones. In his article *Something Borrowed*, Malcolm Gladwell gently supported the practice of using “old words” to establish “new ideas” (127). In *RiP!: A Remix Manifesto*, Brett Gaylor criticized the copyright laws, showing how the current copyright protection institution impeded artists’ creativity (Gaylor 2008). Though I partially agree with the view that the domain of copyright should be limited—more specifically, I disagree with patenting ideas—I insist that the protection of intellectual property is necessary for soliciting creativity. Not only does it promote fairness among creators, but it also protects them from unintended harm. Overall, copyright is more beneficial than copyleft when done right.

Intellectual property should only include parts of creative works that reflect the commitment of the author. There is a trending of patenting abstract ideas. For instance, a software company might try to patent its usage of rounded rectangles for buttons and make such design exclusive to its software. Such practice is harmful; instead, the company should only have copyright of the details of its design, such as the mathematic formula for the curve of its rounded rectangle. There are two reasons. First of all, it is hard, if not impossible, to find out the author of such a general idea. The use of rounded button has been pervasive in everyday life even before the creation of computer: door handles, telephone buttons, and light switches, to name a few. In other fields such as literature, ideas are also hard to attribute. In *Something Borrowed*, Gladwell mentioned that the opera writer Lavery borrowed his phrase “sins and symptoms”, yet the phrase was a quote from Gandhi, who probably learned it from somewhere else (128). It is unreasonable that when we do not know the real author of an idea, we grant that idea to someone simply because that person requests the ownership first. The other reason intellectual property should not apply to vague ideas is that these ideas are scarce. For example, there are only a few possible plots in spy novels (Widdicombe 52). If they are patented, every author of spy novels will likely be a plagiarist. Besides, protecting general ideas can easily lead to monopoly. For example, the first company of a new type of business can declare this business model as their intellectual property and charge every follower a royalty. Moreover, greedy people will be attracted: they will try their best to gain ownership of every general idea that is already widely used in the real life, since if they succeed, they can gain an insane amount of royalties. Therefore, granting ownership of an idea is detrimental to the creativity of our society. Copyright law should not be done this way. After all, as mentioned in *RiP!: A Remix Manifesto*, the very principle behind the first copyright law was to give incentive to the creator (Gaylor 2008) to create *more*, not *less*.

Why is it important to protect the commitment part of a creative work then? It creates a healthy market in which creators compete with each other fairly, contributing more and more excellent works. There is an implicit selection process, just like natural selection that selected *Homo sapiens*, that picks out the best creators. When we are reading a novel, the joy comes from not only the stirring story *per se*; it also comes from the enormous hours the writer spent in the novel, and more importantly, in improving her writing skills. The work is a reflection of the author’s skills and hard work. Evidently, the more welcome a work is, the more likely the author will create excellent work in the future. In *The Plagiarist’s Tale*, Rowan did a “literature mashup”, copying words from other spy novels and made his own one (Widdicombe 53). What he did was more than stealing others' works to gain revenue for himself: he tricked readers into thinking that he was a capable reader who would produce fantastic novels. When the misconduct came to the light, readers naturally felt extremely angry, as their expectations were shattered. Plagiarism of this type must be eliminated. To greedy writers, unpunished plagiarism will encourage them to do the same thing; to writers who genuinely deserve acclaims, their interests will be divided by those plagiarists and they will have less incentive to create new works. The market could only afford a fixed amount of novel writers. When a fake author gain a position in the pool, some potential writer must lose his or her chance, and we might lose a great novel. Some argued that in the field of music, composers also copied others’ pieces of music yet their works are nonetheless welcome (Gaylor 2008). However, these notes are more like ideas I discussed above: they are too trivial to count as a musician’s commitment (Gladwell 121). In other words, even if a band borrows others’ work, audience can still evaluate its members' skills because these skills are reflected in the harmonic integration of music pieces and the emotional performance of the overall work. Similarly, when attending a concert, we applaud the composer's genius as well as the excellent interpretation by the skillful orchestra. To sum up, because of our needs to differentiate more skillful creators from less skillful ones, we have to protect authors’ rights over their intellectual property. Widdicombe called plagiarism as an ethical offense (Widdicombe 114), but I think that the reason why we do not have a law against plagiarism itself is that the ethical offense plays the role of a common law.

Some people will not be convinced by the above arguments. They will claim that what we need is a law against plagiarism rather than a copyright law. If copyright is all about a fair environment, the society can simply check if an author credit all sources appropriately. However, in the real world, it’s far from uncommon that we heard news where original authors of a work fired a lawsuit against works derived from theirs. In *Something Borrowed*, Gladwell recounted the story of an expert named Dorothy Lewis, who found an opera *Frozen* replicated her life story. She felt extremely uncomfortable with it. It's like having every secret of her life exposed. Particularly, “Lewis” in the opera had an affair that never took place in the real life, yet her friends, after watching the opera, thought she did. <restate the statement> In *RiP!: A Remix Manifesto*, Dan O'Neil also told the story of how he strived to gain the ownership of his own artwork (Gaylor 2008). Moreover, one can imagine a situation in which a cute character is used without explicit permission by a company in its advertisement—watchers of that advertisement will think the artist endorse products of that company, a fact that is not necessarily true. These are just a few examples of how harms can be done to authors if they do not formally own their creations. Even Lessig, one major character of *RiP!: A Remix Manifesto* who thinks our current copyright law problematic, partially supported my concern in practice. In his Creative Commons—a set of licenses that encourage distributing creative works freely—has a special type of license that prohibits any kind of derivational works. Without protecting a work's potential income, only these artists interested in money would leave; without copyright in general, even those dedicated to art will refuse to contribute.

In conclusion, I think the protection of intellectual property is a necessity, regardless the way we distribute and consume creative works. The purpose of copyright is to encourage more creative works rather than obstructing creativity. Ideas should not be protected, since it is unhelpful, it not harmful, to a creative society. Instead, we should protect the hard work of creators so that a fair environment for creation can be promoted and creators can be protected from unexpected harms.
