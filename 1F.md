Has anyone ever had a thought that privacy might be a bad thing? That might happen when we read a news about how terrorists successfully scheduled an attack using Telegram, a chatting app employing end-to-end encryption. In his essay *Visible Man*, Singer made a bold attempt to make a non-mainstream voice: though people’s privacy is often violated when using modern technology, the advantages of such technology outweigh its disadvantages; particularly, people can harness it to hold the government in check. However, I think not only did he underestimate the adverse outcome of no privacy protection, but he also overestimated the benefits brought by a transparent government. Overall, “a world without secrets” creates more problems than it solves.

Singer presented two reasons why government-rule large-scale data collection activities have less adverse outcomes than people usually thought, but neither of them is convincing. First, Singer pointed out was that there *might* be some American suspects proven clean with data collected by the government. This justification is untenable even if we ignore his lack of evidence. Underlying modern judicial systems is a fundamental principle called *presumption of innocence*: the accused don’t need to provide evidence to convince they are clean; it’s the prosecutors who should prove them guilty. Therefore, it’s needless to show a citizen clean using collected data. One may argue that sometimes the government might have violated this principle. However, in such case we shall fix the judicial system; the benefit brought by breaching privacy is *ad hoc* and cannot justify such practice. In his second argument, Singer said that an authoritarian regime could suppress opponents, “with or without electronic data”. The quoted phrase has two interpretations: either he meant authoritarian rule could silence dissidents with only non-electronic data, or without any form of data. From the context, I believe he meant the second interpretation. Such a claim is clearly not in accord with the real world. On the one hand, even in countries as authoritarian as China and Russia, Xi and Putin still employ the judicial systems to arrest protesters. A society requires order for steady development, but arbitrarily eliminating opponents can destroy it. As a result, most authoritarian leaders need to *rule by law*. Even though they can “maximize” evidence against their opponents, but they cannot create evidence from nowhere. On the other hand, online personal information can reveal the physical identity of a protester. Therefore, in an authoritarian state, the less privacy is protected, the higher cost protesters are spending hiding themselves. This reason also weakens Singer’s claim if what he intended was the first interpretation discussed above. To sum up, exposing privacy to the governments is more harmful than Singer had analyzed, which weakens his main claim.

Leaking privacy to corporations or criminal groups could also be detrimental, but Singer completely ignored it. To most people, data collection plans by these organizations are more worrisome than those conducted by the government. First, data collection by corporations is a universal practice. As Singer mentioned in his essay, any large-scale activity inevitably induces some people to do evil. Therefore, companies collecting data are unavoidably unsafe. What makes things worse is that we cannot enforce open, which gives it more chances to do evil. Moreover, crimes are prevalent on the Internet. It’s likely for a hacker to steal personal information from the government or Internet companies and utilize the information to set up spam. It’s also conceivable that terrorists can acquire physical locations of those peace defenders. From this perspective, the disclosure of privacy might threaten the most ordinary citizens’ wealth and lives. While some may say our data are safe on servers, we should not forget that even documents stored in the American government can be stolen by WikiLeak, not to mention data stored at those Silicon Valley startups. Since the author only mentioned that big corporations might be an issue when describing the open nature of our society and he ignored online crimes completely, his attempt to justify forgoing privacy is further undermined.

Though Singer was right that a transparent government is good, the benefit of this openness is not as much as he had analyzed. To Singer, in an ideal society, there should be some organizations exposing the government’s misconducts to the general public so that the latter will restrain the government. He also quoted Assange’s belief that people need more information to make accurate judgments. However, though it is necessary to have information to make sound judgments, the availability of information doesn’t guarantee right decisions. People are too lazy to discover facts about the world. For instance, it’s reasonable to believe that not so many people have read WikiLeak’s documents by themselves because we have an occupation known as journalists dedicated to reading materials for others. Consequently, there must exist numerous blind spots about the government that the general public will never know, even if the information is *available*. A hot topic will draw the attention of so many people that even if there is no one actively digging information about it, someone is going to leak something; a lost topic, though worth the spotlight, will not be mentioned by the media and thus be forgotten forever. This characteristic of communication hampers the benefit of a transparent government severely. Moreover, knowing an issue does not mean that it can be solved. Even without open data, every college students could realize that their textbooks are overpriced, but is there any action taken against it? Well, there is, and Aaron Swartz committed his suicide. People need NGOs to unite their strengths for a common objective. It remains debate whether our political sphere makes the development of NGOs obstacle-free, which raises a new doubt about Singer’s claim.

An undeniable advantage of a transparent government is the panoptic effect. Unfortunately, Singer talked Panopticon merely to “fancify” his article and didn’t discuss it in-depth. The idea is similar to the Panopticon: the government does not need its every employee to be always supervised by someone. As long as officers realize that someone might be examining their behaviors, they won’t risk their careers to do illegal things. To make the model work, it is necessary to isolate government officers from their supervisors, or they might corrupt together. Because the general public’s interest has no intersection with that of civil servants interested in rent-seeking, people are good overseers. Still, this requires a combination of institutions to protect people’s freedom. All in all, the public is inefficient in both knowing the government—regardless of the latter’s openness—and fighting injustice. The panoptic effect will appear with transparency, but Singer didn’t discuss this topic at all. Therefore, the author failed to show the advantages of a transparent are significant enough.

At the last section, Singer returned to the topic of why privacy is not that important, yet he failed again. This time, he tried to show that people behaved better when their privacy was deprived. The first example he gave was that people were more honestly if they were told to be watched. However, the privacy issue people concern is their privacy in their private life. It’s natural to give up some freedom and obey rules in a public space, and it’s reasonable therefore to employ certain strategies to increase obedience. In the third example, when an energy company presented its customers with both their energy use and the average use in that area, the overall energy consumption reduced. Not only was the personal information anonymized, but the author also failed to consider the counterargument that users merely want to save their expenses. Overall, his analysis is weak. To see how terrible a society deprived of privacy right would be, one can simply pick up a history book of Nazi German or schedule a visit to North Korea.

I believe the reason Singer returned to the topic was that he discovered the biggest flaw implied in his central claim: to obtain a transparent government the public must renounce their rights to privacy. Is this necessary? No. In fact, the Americans, like citizens in most well-developed countries, have a transparent and honest government while maintaining their privacy. He failed to analyze the negative impact of violating privacy systematically, from authoritarian governments, profit-seeking Internet companies, to criminals as well as terrorists. Though his claim that a transparent government has advantages is correct, he could hardly convince readers to believe that these benefits outweigh the price of depriving everyone’s privacy. Singer could have composed a strong argument if he did not intend to justify activities that breach people’s privacy. Unfortunately, he chose the road less traveled.
