Have anyone ever had a thought that privacy might be a bad thing? That might happen when we read a news about how terrorists used Telegram, another chatting app employing end-to-end encryption, to schedule a successful attack. But there are still so many downsides about violating privacy. Nevertheless, in his essay *Visible Man*, Singer made a bold attempt to make a non-mainstream voice: though people’s privacy is often being violated when using modern technology, the advantages of such technology outweigh its disadvantages; particularly, people can harness it to hold the government in check. However, I think not only did he underestimate the adverse outcome of an open world to ordinary people, but he also overestimated the benefits brought by a transparent government. Overall, “a world without secrets” creates more problems than it solves.

Singer presented two reasons why government-rule large-scale data collection activities have less adverse outcomes than people usually thought, but neither of them are convincing. First, Singer pointed out was that there *might* be some Americans proven clean with data collected by the government. Even ignoring the fact that there is no datum supporting his argument, we could still find his imagination ridiculous. It is common sense that *presumption of innocence* is a fundamental principle underlying modern judicial systems, which says that the accused don’t need to provide evidence to convince they are clean—it’s the prosecutors who should prove they guilty. Therefore, the existence of collected data that prove citizens clean, as Singer suggested, would be unnecessary. One may argue that under certain secret cases the government might have violated this principle when judging American citizens. However, in such case it’s the judicial system which should be fixed; the benefit brought by giving up privacy is *ad hoc* and should not be used to justify such practice. The second justification Singer gave was that an authoritarian regime could silence opponents, “with or without electronic data”. The phrase can be interpreted in two ways: either he meant an authoritarian regime could silence its opponents with only non-electronic data, or without any form of data. From the context, I believe he meant the second interpretation. Such a claim are clearly not in accord with the real world. On the one hand, even in countries as authoritarian as China and Russia, Xi and Putin still need to employ the judicial systems to put protesters into the jail. To maintain steady development a society requires order, and eliminating opponents arbitrarily can create terror and destroy such order. As a result, most authoritarian leaders need to *rule by law*; even though they can “maximize” evidences against their opponents, they still need some piece of evidence to start with. On the other hand, online personal information is often the key to reveal the physical identity of a protester. Therefore, in an authoritarian state, the more privacy is being leaked, the higher cost protesters are spending hiding themselves. This reason also weakens Singer’s claim if what he intended was the first interpretation discussed above. To sum up, exposing privacy to the governments is more harmful than Singer had analyzed, which weakens his overall claim.

Leaking privacy to corporations or criminal groups could also be detrimental, which are ignored by Singer nearly completely. In fact, to most people data collection by these organizations are more troublesome than those conducted by the government. First, data collection by corporations is a universal practice; as Singer mentioned in his essay, such a large-scale activity inevitably induce some people to do evil. What makes things worse is that unlike the government, except for certain unusual cases, we cannot make a company open and that without direct supervision big corporations are even more likely to do evil. Second, the Internet is a dangerous place where crackers—those who employ computer technology for illegal purposes, traditionally known as hackers—hunt around. It’s likely that these criminal groups manage to steal personal information from the government or Internet companies and utilize the information to setup spam. It’s also conceivable that terrorists like ISIL’s followers acquire physical locations of those peace fighters. From this perspective, disclosure of privacy might threaten even the most ordinary citizens’ wealth and lives. While some may say our data are quite safe on servers, we should not forget that even documents stored in the American government can be stolen by WikiLeak, not to mention data stored at those Silicon Valley startups. Since the author only mentioned that big corporations might be an issue when describing the open nature of our society and he ignored criminal groups completely, his claim that giving up privacy is not as bad as people often think is further undermined.

After refuting Singer’s premise that the negative impact of a “visible world” is more trivial than most people thought, it’s time to analyze why the positive outcome of this kind of openness is not as much as Singer promised. Besides, I think the benefits brought by openness is actually a direct consequence of good institutions in different aspects of the society rather than this particular kind of institution. In Singer’s imagination, an ideal society should be a place where some organizations committed to exposing the government’s misconducts to the general public in order to restrain the government. He also quoted Assange’s belief to express his idea that people need more information to make accurate judgements. However, though it is necessary to have accurate information to make good judgements, the availability of accurate information doesn’t guarantee right judgements. People are too lazy to absorb the knowledge around themselves. How many people will read WikiLeak’s documents by themselves? Because we have a whole occupation dedicated to reading documents for others—we call them journalists—it’s reasonable to infer that the number is small. Consequently, there must exist a myriad of blind spots about the government that the general public will never know, even if the information is *available*. This creates a vicious cycle: a hot topic will draw the attention of so many people that even if there is no one actively digging information about it, someone is going to leak this information; a lost topic, though worth the spotlight, will not be mentioned by the media and thus disappear from everyone. It is because of this feature of communication that the benefit of a transparent government is severely hampered. Moreover, knowing the issue does not mean that we can solve them. Even without open data every college students could realize that their textbooks are overpriced, but is there any action taken against it? Well, there is, and Aaron Swartz committed his suicide. People need NGOs to gather their strengths for a common objective. The question whether the political sphere makes NGOs’ development obstacle-free remains debate, yet it is well known that a rule of law society with sufficient institutions that protect individual rights is necessary for such organizations to grow significant. From this perspective it is clear that a transparent government solely is meaningless—we need other institutions. There is indeed something very beneficial about a transparent government—the panoptic effect—but unfortunately it is not discussed by Singer. The idea is similar to the panopticon: a government does not its every employee to be supervised by some dedicated group at all times, since as long as the officer knows that their behavior at some time might be examined, they won’t risk their career to do illegal things. However, to make the model work as expected, it is necessary to isolate government officers from their supervisors, or they might seek rent together. The general public’s interest has little intersection with that of officers who are interested in rent-seeking. Therefore, they are indeed good supervisors. Still, this requires a combination of institutions to protect people’s freedom. All in all, since the public is inefficient in knowing the government and working together, the benefits of a transparent government are not as significant as Singer described; though the panoptic effect will appear with transparency, this is a topic ignored by the author altogether; most importantly, all of these benefits are built upon a series of institutions, the efficiency of which is also not discussed by him.

Perhaps the most “outstanding” logical error of this essay is that Singer binds the openness of the public with the transparency of the government. Is this necessary? No. In fact the Americans, just like citizens in most well developed countries, already have a quite transparent and honest government. Singer could simply argue that a transparent government is more beneficial—it is, though its benefit cannot pay the price of asking everyone to give up their privacy. Even the author himself might have realized this problem and therefore chose to discuss the benefits of people’s accepting openness of themselves in the last section, but his argument’s validity is again questionable. The first example he gave was that people behaved more honestly in the public if they were told to be watched. Yet the privacy issue people concern is their privacy in their private life—it’s natural to give up some freedom and obey rules in a public space, and it’s reasonable therefore to employ certain strategies to increase obedience. In the third example, when an energy company presented its customers with both their own energy use and the average use in that area, the overall energy consumption reduced. Despite the fact that personal information is anonymized, it’s likely that users merely want to save their expenses. The author do not fully address these possible counterarguments. In contrast, to see how terrible such an open society would be, one can simply pick up a history book of Nazi German or schedule a visit to North Korea.

In conclusion, Singer failed to analyze the negative impact of violating privacy systematically, from authoritarian governments, profit-seeking Internet companies, to crackers as well as terrorists. In addition, though his claim that a transparent government has advantages is correct, not only did he miss an important reason why this is the case, his argument on how people can make better judgements do not necessarily hold. It is laws and institutions which are playing a much more vital role in ensuring our society works as desired. Last but not least, there is no logical relation between abandoning citizens’ privacy and making our governments transparent. He could have written a better article if he did not intend to justify these anti-privacy conducts. Unfortunately, he chose the road less traveled.
