Have anyone ever had a thought that privacy might be a bad thing? That might happen when we read a news about how terrorists used Telegram, another chatting app employing end-to-end encryption, to schedule a successful attack. But there are still so many downsides about violating privacy. Nevertheless, in his essay *Visible Man*, Singer made a bold attempt to make a non-mainstream voice: though people’s privacy is often being violated when using modern technology, the advantages of such technology outweigh its disadvantages; particularly, people can harness it to hold the government in check. However, I think not only did he underestimate the adverse outcome of an open world to ordinary people, but he also overestimated the benefits brought by a transparent government. Overall, “a world without secrets” creates more problems than it solves.

Singer presented two reasons why government-rule large-scale data collection activities have less adverse outcomes than people usually thought, but neither of them are convincing. First, Singer pointed out was that there *might* be some Americans proven clean with data collected by the government. Even ignoring the fact that there is no datum supporting his argument, we could still find his imagination ridiculous. It is common sense that *presumption of innocence* is a fundamental principle underlying modern judicial systems, which says that the accused don’t need to provide evidence to convince they are clean—it’s the prosecutors who should prove they guilty. Therefore, the existence of collected data that prove citizens clean, as Singer suggested, would be unnecessary. One may argue that under certain secret cases the government might have violated this principle when judging American citizens. However, in such case it’s the judicial system which should be fixed; the benefit brought by giving up privacy is *ad hoc* and should not be used to justify such practice. The second justification Singer gave was that an authoritarian regime could silence opponents, “with or without electronic data”. The phrase can be interpreted in two ways: either he meant an authoritarian regime could silence its opponents with only non-electronic data, or without any form of data. From the context, I believe he meant the second interpretation. Such a claim are clearly not in accord with the real world. On the one hand, even in countries as authoritarian as China and Russia, Xi and Putin still need to employ the judicial systems to put protesters into the jail. To maintain steady development a society requires order, and eliminating opponents arbitrarily can create terror and destroy such order. As a result, most authoritarian leaders need to *rule by law*; even though they can “maximize” evidences against their opponents, they still need some piece of evidence to start with. On the other hand, online personal information is often the key to reveal the physical identity of a protester. Therefore, in an authoritarian state, the more privacy is being leaked, the higher cost protesters are spending hiding themselves. This reason also weakens Singer’s claim if what he intended was the first interpretation discussed above. To sum up, exposing privacy to the governments is more harmful than Singer had analyzed, which weakens his overall claim.

Leaking privacy to corporations or criminal groups could also be detrimental, which are ignored by Singer nearly completely. In fact, to most people data collection by these organizations are more troublesome than those conducted by the government. First, data collection by corporations is a universal practice; as Singer mentioned in his essay, such a large-scale activity inevitably induce some people to do evil. What makes things worse is that unlike the government, except for certain unusual cases, we cannot make a company open and that without direct supervision big corporations are even more likely to do evil. Second, the Internet is a dangerous place where crackers—those who employ computer technology for illegal purposes, traditionally known as hackers—hunt around. It’s likely that these criminal groups manage to steal personal information from the government or Internet companies and utilize the information to setup spam. It’s also conceivable that terrorists like ISIL’s followers acquire physical locations of those peace fighters. From this perspective, disclosure of privacy might threaten even the most ordinary citizens’ wealth and lives. While some may say our data are quite safe on servers, we should not forget that even documents stored in the American government can be stolen by WikiLeak, not to mention data stored at those Silicon Valley startups. Since the author only mentioned that big corporations might be an issue when describing the open nature of our society and he ignored criminal groups completely, his claim that giving up privacy is not as bad as people often think is further undermined.

Like when proving a set is identical to another rigorously we need to prove each set is a subset of the other, when weighing the pros and cons of ”a world without secrets” we should also examine each side carefully. Since I have demonstrated that Singer underestimated the adverse outcomes of giving up the privacy of the general public, now it’s time to see his argument about how a transparent government could be helpful. Unexpectedly, his discussion of this section is also full of logical errors and shows his ignorance of common sense.

Singer claimed that a transparent government is beneficial and gave the example of WikiLeak. I do agree with him on this very point, but I don’t think the benefits of transparency overweigh the price we need to pay when we give up our privacy. Instead, I think he also overestimated the power of openness. He quoted Assange’s belief to express his idea that people need more information to make accurate judgements. It is true that information is necessary to make accurate judgements, but this does not imply that with sufficient information people will make judgments. Why? Most people are to lazy to absorb the knowledge of the world. This is clearly reflected from the fact that even in 2016 when everyone is talking about human rights or freedom, Donald Trump could still easily use words that can not even convince himself to attract more than ten million supporters in the world’s most developed country. Besides, knowing the issue does not mean that we can solve them. Even without open data every college students could realize that their textbooks are overpriced, but is there any action taken against it? Well, there is, and Aaron Swartz committed his suicide. This is a problem known as collective action problem. The price to solve a problem for an individual is so high that everyone wants to free ride. A mass amount of people can hardly achieve anything: they may be willing to sign a signature, but much less willing to demonstrate, not to mention spend a significant amount of money to advertise their demands. Some may say with enough attention NGOs will come from nowhere and lead the people, but I would like to say that the very environment in which NGOs form is not a transparent government but a rule of law society with sufficient institutions that protect individual rights. There is indeed something very beneficial about a transparent government—the panoptic effect. The idea is that the government officer do not need to be supervised by a dedicated group of people, because as long as the officer knows there is a risk in doing illegal things, they would not choose to do it. Though this perfectly solved the problem of collective action I mentioned above, when the interest is too significant, I believe any politicians are willing to risk their careers, just like those who committ crimes even though they know the laws. We still need a series of institutions specialized in keeping the government incorruptible. Unfortunately, Singer, though mentioning the panopticon to make his essay more fancy, didn’t consider this point at all; and as I have said, this model does bring benefits but not large enough.

Openness do increase the costs of governments’ misconducts and eliminate myriad ordinarily evil ideas. However, why do both the people and the government have to accept transparency? Singer could simply argue that a transparent government is more beneficial—it is, though its benefit cannot pay the price of asking everyone to give up their privacy. Even the author himself might have realized the overall weakness of his essay and therefore chose to discuss the benefits of people’s accepting openness of themselves in the last section. However, are these examples what we privacy defenders fight against? Certainly not. It’s natural that one should give up some freedom and obey rules in a public space, and it’s reasonable therefore to employ certain strategies to increase obedience—as long as our rights in our private space are not violated. The second and the third examples are even more ridiculous: how could this count as being observed? In the donation example, we can safely say that callers are merely affected by others’ altruistic behaviors instead of the notion that they are observed. In the energy consumption example, we can also say that these customers merely want to save their money. The author do not fully address these possible counterarguments. In contrast, to see how terrible a panoptic society would be, one can simply pick up a history book of Nazi German or schedule a visit to North Korea.

In conclusion, Singer failed to analyze the negative impact of violating privacy systematically, from authoritarian governments, profit-seeking Internet companies, to crackers as well as terrorists. In addition, though his claim that a transparent government has advantages is correct, not only did he miss an important reason why this is the case, his argument on how people can make better judgements do not necessarily hold. It is laws and institutions which are playing a much more vital role in ensuring our society works as desired. Last but not least, there is no logical relation between abandoning citizens’ privacy and making our governments transparent. He could have written a better article if he did not intend to justify these anti-privacy conducts. Unfortunately, he chose the road less traveled.
