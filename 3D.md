Controlling Question: With our advances in big data, should correlation rather than causation be our default target when we are solving a problem?

Claim: With big data, we can find correlations much easier than we could find causations in the pre big data age. Since correlations are sufficient for solving most problems, we should take finding correlations as our default strategy in solving a problem and apply big data whenever possible.

Plan:

- Correlations are sufficient for most problems, and big data can yield those correlations.
  - Give an analogy of correlations. We are now like an omnipresent god so that we can do global predications. Give facts as evidence.
  - Link the above analogy with big data.
- Using big data does not necessarily undermine human’s pursuit for causation. Quite the contrary, it can facilitate such pursuit.
  - The nature of human society prevents us from blindly pursuing correlations. Examples include academe.
  - It can give people a general idea of an unknown field, which can guide them for future research.
- Counterargument: if correlations do work, why people, until we were able to process big data, why did people gradually adopted the mindset of finding causations rather than correlations.
  - On the one hand, in the past, due to our limited world view and methodology, our predications were generally so imprecise that these predications were inapplicable.
  - On the other hand, correlations did play an important role under the form of ”educated guess” and ”bias”.
