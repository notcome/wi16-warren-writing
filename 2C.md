It’s hard to define a principle to differentiate plagiarism from creativity, since new work is developed from old ones rather than created from nowhere. The more details one considers, the more complicated the situation is. Therefore, it would be more useful and approachable to consider the standard in some “pure” aspects, namely separating a work’s unoriginality from its usefulness. Here, I would like to discuss three aspects, what new knowledge does a work create, does the author deserve what they receive, and is there harm done to the cited sources’ creators.

There are, as I can think of, two dimensions of the creativity of a work. The first dimension regards the positive effects exerted on the work’s receivers. For instance, an improvement on mathematical notations merely repackages an old idea, but the new system might inspire other mathematicians to make substantial progress. The music mashup by GirlTalk invented no new technique, but it does make a listener feel high more easily. The effects can be quite versatile even in the same field. For example, Rowan’s _Assassin of Secrets_ contributed neither a new spy novel plot or an interesting writing style (Lizzie 109, 110). However, it is clearly an excellent new work for one who is purely interested in enjoying yet another spy novel. Initial positive reactions to the novel confirmed this point (Lizzie 109). The second dimension on creativity is about making an idea more well-known. The special relativity proposed by Einstein is creative in this dimension. But a completely new idea is not always necessary: an English translation of plato’s *Republic*, or a set of notes to Thucydides’s *History of the Peloponnesian War*, makes an idea more accessible. Though no new idea is added to the pool of human knowledge, but the average knowledge of every human being is increased, which makes a new idea more likely to occur. Rowan’s novelization of _The Venturesome Voyage of Captain Voss_, a memoir published in 1913, rediscovered an old idea that might had be forgotten by the human beings (Widdicombe 111). From this perspective, it’s worth some praise.

Naturally, a question is raised: does Rowan deserve the credit he received? This question cannot be correctly answered unless we address a deeper question first: why do we need to reward people when they contribute something? The first reason for this is to provide incentives for them to contribute more in the future, as mentioned in the video. The second reason is that by providing both material interests and reputations a community implicitly selects someone with good capabilities. Resources are more concentrated around with those who are heavily rewarded due to their previous contribution, and these resources will in turn be used more efficiently. Consider the case of Rowan. By publishing a popular novel, people expect him to be a *good writer*, rather than a *good spy novel writer*. People think he will be capable of writing in general and have high expectations as well as investments (e.g. from publishers and editors). These expectations and investments are destined to be wasted. Moreover, such precious resources could have been used elsewhere and led to the creation of some excellent works. Neither did Rowan deserve any kind of incentives. The society rewards authors because people want to see works of that kind. Americans have a very high standard of plagiarism when talking about novels, therefore they felt cheated when they realized that *Assassin of Secrets* was not that original. A related issue is honesty. People generally promote honesty as this will increase the overall efficiency of the society. There is an implicit implication when Rowan didn’t explicitly declared his borrowing: his work was original according to people’s standard to novels. Rowan was aware of this, and his behavior was cheating. Dishonesty should be punished. *Frozen* by Lavery, in contrast, was a work that reflects her ability in composing an opera (Gladwell 127). She did deserve resources concentrated around her for this particular work. While some might argue that make an opera as real as possible is also an important ability, it’s not that insignificant. Audience of an opera also didn’t have a presupposition that everything undeclared is conceived by mind or made from solely the composer’s life experience. Even Lavery herself said that she didn’t realize any negative consequence of such borrowing without permission (Gladwell 126). She didn’t cheat on purpose, so there was no honesty issue.

However, harm was still done. *Frozen* was too similar to what happened to Dorothy Lewis. As a result, even some fictional part of *Frozen*’s plot was thought as facts about Lewis’s life. This clearly troubled the original author of the whole story about investigation into serial killers (Gladwell 127). These negative consequences are arbitrary and hard to consider in a general way, we could only discuss them case by case. However, authors of works have a more clear understanding about potential misuses of their works, either discovered by themselves or suggested by their friends. Therefore, author should have freedom to the uses of their works in a reasonable way. The definition of reasonable ways is the responsibility of laws. Such freedom should be protected, as otherwise the author might choose not to publish their works in the first place. From this point of view, intellectual property is also a property: one can refuse to work for a property if the rights over that property is not guaranteed. Another type of harm done to the original authors is much more general. It’s about material interests and fairness of competition. As mentioned above, we need to protect the idea’s owner to encourage everyone’s creativity. It’s also about fairness: competitors may choose to copy someone’s work use resources other than that work per se to win the battle. This not only affects everyone’s incentive and make the natural selection of capable agents less efficient.

Why is it so hard to determine whether a creation is original? Because human knowledge is developed from our previous works rather than created out of thin air. When some composition’s originality is not clear, whether it is plagiarism or not depends of the reviewer’s emphasis on the creative part or the borrowed part. Therefore, I propose to divide the standard for judging creativity into three aspects: new ideas created by the work, whether the author deserves what he or she receives, and whether there is harm done to the “lender”. By examining the issue from these three perspectives, I believe one could respond to the question of originality in a way that fits best to the circumstance.
