\maketitle

This program builds on the idea that “learning is an evolving, participative, and collaborative endeavor”. In addition to its high demanding on each student, a significant portion of this course is about collaboration—discussions, peer reviews, etc. From these principles we can summarize the course’s policies rationally.

To begin with, a student’s commitment to conferences are not only essential to the student themself’s learning but will also affect the collaboration between everyone in the course. Therefore, each significant failure of participating in a conference, which is going to be defined below, is counted as an “absence” and more than two absences may lead to failing the class and advised withdraw. First, attendance is mandatory and missing a conference is an absence. Second, since coming late to the class—though having a less negative impact to an individual—will still disturb other students and hamper the discussion, coming late for more than five minutes more than twice will count as an absence. Last but not  least, because using of electronic devices, especially phones, is also distracting to everyone in the class, persistent use of such technology is also an absence.

Similarly, failing to submit drafts and revisions on time is also detrimental to every student in the class and will be seriously penalized, because such incident is more than a reflection of the lack of commitment from the student in question: it also slow down the whole course’s progress. An exception is to make a special agreement with the instructor well before the paper’s deadline. When a late paper is inevitable, one should manage to reach an agreement with the instructor on when and how the paper will be turned in. In such case, there will be grade penalties at the disposition of the instructor, with an upper bound of lowering one third of the grade for each graded assignment. The penalty may be increased for each day after the paper is due. Since the excuse of a late paper will affect one’s grade, falsifying or fabricating the fact is a violation of academic integrity.

Lastly, it seems fair to adjust one’s grade based on one’s commitment—as different students start with different writing background. The factors to be considered are presence and participation, peer work, reflection, and overall improvement. The adjustment process, known as process grade, which takes place after grading each of the three final essays, can raise, lower, or leave unchanged one’s grade by one third of a letter. Process grade is determined by the instructor.
